Dynamic programming
  - Dynamic programming starts by solving subproblems and builds up to solving the big problem.
  - Every dynamic-programming algorithm starts with a grid.

    • Dynamic programming is useful when you’re trying to optimize something given a constraint.
    • You can use dynamic programming when the problem can be broken into discrete subproblems.
    • Every dynamic-programming solution involves a grid.
    • The values in the cells are usually what you’re trying to optimize.
    • Each cell is a subproblem, so think about how you can divide your problem into subproblems.
    • There’s no single formula for calculating a dynamic-programming solution.
