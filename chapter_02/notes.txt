How memory works?
  Each time you want to store an item in memory, you ask the computer for some space, and it gives you 
  an address where you can store your item.

Arrays and linked lists:
  Using an array means all your tasks are stored contiguously (right next to each other) in memory.
  With linked lists, your items can be anywhere in memory.
  Here are the run times for common operations on arrays and lists:
  Arrays          =>    reading: O(1), Insertion: O(n), Deletions: O(n).
  Linked Lists    =>    reading: O(n), Insertion: O(1), Deletions: O(1).
