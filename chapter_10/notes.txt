K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN)
  - K-Nearest Neighbours is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms 
  in Machine Learning. It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense 
  application in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection.

  - Suppose you’re Netflix, and you want to build a movie recommendations system for your 
  users.
  - Recap
    • KNN is used for classification and regression and involves looking at the k-nearest neighbors.
    • Classification = categorization into a group.
    • Regression = predicting a response (like a number).
    • Feature extraction means converting an item (like a fruit or a user) into a list of numbers 
      that can be compared.
    • Picking good features is an important part of a successful KNN algorithm.
