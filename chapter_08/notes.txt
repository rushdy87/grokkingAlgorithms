Greedy Algorithmic
  Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the 
  next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. So the problems where choosing 
  locally optimal also leads to global solution are the best fit for Greedy.
  
• Greedy algorithms optimize locally, hoping to end up with a global optimum.
• NP-complete problems have no known fast solution.
• If you have an NP-complete problem, your best bet is to use an approximation algorithm.
• Greedy algorithms are easy to write and fast to run, so they make good approximation algorithms.
