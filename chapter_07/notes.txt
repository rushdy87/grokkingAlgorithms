- each edge in the graph has a number associated with it. These are called weights.
- A graph with weights is called a weighted graph. A graph without weights is called 
  an unweighted graph.
- To calculate the shortest path in an unweighted graph, use breadth-first search. To 
  calculate the shortest path in a weighted graph, use Dijkstra’s algorithm. Graphs can 
  also have cycles.

Dijkstra's Algorithm
The Dijkstra algorithm is an algorithm used to solve the shortest path problem in a graph. 
This means that given a number of nodes and the edges between them as well as the “length” 
of the edges (referred to as “weight”), the Dijkstra algorithm is finds the shortest path 
from the specified start node to all other nodes. Nodes are sometimes referred to as vertices 
(plural of vertex) - here, we’ll call them nodes.

Description of the Algorithm
The basic principle behind the Dijkstra algorithm is to iteratively look at the node with the 
currently smallest distance to the source and update all not yet visited neighbors if the path 
to it via the current node is shorter. In more detail, this leads to the following Steps:
  1- Initialize the distance to the starting node as 0 and the distances to all other nodes as infinite
  2- Set all nodes to “unvisited”
  3- While we haven’t visited all nodes:
    -Find the node with currently shortest distance from the source (for the first pass, 
      this will be the source node itself)
    - For all nodes next to it that we haven’t visited yet, check if the currently smallest 
      distance to that neighbor is bigger than if we were to go via the current node
    - If it is, update the smallest distance of that neighbor to be the distance from the source 
      to the current node plus the distance from the current node to that neighbor
In the end, the array we used to keep track of the currently shortest distance from the source to 
all other nodes will contain the (final) shortest distances.

Recap
• Breadth-first search is used to calculate the shortest path for an unweighted graph.
• Dijkstra’s algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path for a weighted graph.
• Dijkstra’s algorithm works when all the weights are positive.
• If you have negative weights, use the Bellman-Ford algorithm.
