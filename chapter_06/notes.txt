What is a graph?
  - A graph models a set of connections.
  - A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes 
    also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More 
    formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by 
    G(E, V).
  - Components of a Graph:
    Vertices: Vertices are the fundamental units of the graph. Sometimes, vertices are also known as vertex 
              or nodes. Every node/vertex can be labeled or unlabelled.
    Edges:    Edges are drawn or used to connect two nodes of the graph. It can be ordered pair of nodes in a 
              directed graph. Edges can connect any two nodes in any possible way. There are no rules. Sometimes, 
              edges are also known as arcs. Every edge can be labeled/unlabelled.

Breadth-first search
  - Breadth- first search is a different kind of search algorithm: one that runs on graphs. It can help answer 
    two types of questions:
    * Question type 1: Is there a path from node A to node B?
    * Question type 2: What is the shortest path from node A to node B?

Queues:
  - Queues are similar to stacks. You can’t access random elements in the queue. Instead, there are two only 
    operations, enqueue and dequeue.
  - If you enqueue two items to the list, the first item you added will be dequeued before the second item.
  - The queue is called a FIFO data structure: First In, First Out.
    In contrast, a stack is a LIFO data structure: Last In, First Out.

Recap
• Breadth-first search tells you if there’s a path from A to B.
• If there’s a path, breadth-first search will find the shortest path.
• If you have a problem like “find the shortest X,” try modeling your problem as a graph, and use breadth-first 
  search to solve.
• A directed graph has arrows, and the relationship follows the direction of the arrow (rama -> adit means “rama 
  owes adit money”).
• Undirected graphs don’t have arrows, and the relationship goes both ways (ross - rachel means “ross dated rachel 
  and rachel dated ross”).
• Queues are FIFO (First In, First Out).
• Stacks are LIFO (Last In, First Out).
• You need to check people in the order they were added to the search list, so the search list needs to be a queue. 
  Otherwise, you won’t get the shortest path.
• Once you check someone, make sure you don’t check them again. Otherwise, you might end up in an infinite loop.
